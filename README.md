1: Nearly all modern graphics system are raster based. This means that the images we see on the output device is ann array or elements(pixels). 

2: There are two fundementally different types of processing in our architecture. On the frontend we use geometric processing with various transformations
of vertices (vertex shading, clipping) and we also use GPUS that perform most graphic operations at the chip level. This pipeline architecture is the dominant type of 
high performance system.
